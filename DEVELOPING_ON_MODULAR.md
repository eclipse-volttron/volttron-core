# Developing on Modular Volttron


The following documentation steps through the process of setting up your environment to start
developing on modular VOLTTRON.

There are requirements in order to follow this README. The following requirements should be installed system-wide, 
so they are available to be used throughout the README.

* Poetry 1.2.2

## Installing poetry

VOLTTRON uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), a dependency management and packaging tool for Python. If you don't have Poetry installed on your machine, follow [these steps](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) to install it on your machine.

To check if Poetry is installed, run `poetry --version`. If you receive the error 'command not found: poetry', add the following line to your '~/.bashrc' script: ```export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin```.

### Recommended configuration for poetry

By default, poetry creates a virtual environment in {cache-dir}/virtualenvs. To configure 'poetry' to create the virtualenv inside this project's root directory, run the following command:

[```poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true```](https://python-poetry.org/docs/configuration)


# Development

##  New Agent 
* Please use the tool [copier-poetry-volttron-agent](https://github.com/VOLTTRON/copier-poetry-volttron-agent/tree/develop) to create a new agent. 

## Existing Agent

The recommended development path is outlined below:

* Fork the Agent repository on Github
* Clone the repository in your local environment
* Setup the environment using poetry

```shell
poetry install 
```

* Create a working branch off of 'develop'
* Make a code change
* Run tests

```shell
poetry run pytest tests/
```
* Create a Pull Request (PR)
  * Please see the [contributing.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) document before contributing to this repository.
  * Go on your forked Github repository and create a PR.  

## Building a Wheel

To build a wheel from this project, execute the following command at the root level of this repository:

```shell
poetry build
```

The wheel and source distribution will be located in the ```./dist/``` directory.

## Bumping version number of project

To bump the version number of the project execute one of the following.

```shell
# patch, minor, major, prepatch, preminor, premajor, prerelease

# use patch
user@path$ poetry patch

# output
Bumping version from 0.2.0-alpha.0 to 0.2.0

# use prepatch
user@path$ poetry version prepatch

# output
Bumping version from 0.2.0 to 0.2.1-alpha.0


## Testing

To write tests, install [`volttron-testing`](https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/volttron-testing/tree/develop) as a 
dev dependency. Use poetry to install `volttron-testing` into your environment:

```shell
poetry add volttron-testing
```

## Tests

[`volttron-testing`](https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/volttron-testing/tree/develop) is Volttron's testing framework to support writing tests on Modular Volttron. It offers several tools that you can use to write tests. 

### Unit Tests

Use [`TestServer`](https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/volttron-testing/blob/develop/src/volttrontesting/server_mock.py) to create the testing environment for unit tests. For an example of a unit test, 
see the unit tests created for [volttron-listener](https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/volttron-listener/blob/develop/tests/test_agent_workings.py)


### Integration Tests

Use [`PlatformWrapper`](https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/volttron-testing/blob/develop/src/volttrontesting/platformwrapper.py) to create the testing environment for integration tests. For an example of an integration test, 
see the integration tests created for [volttron-listener](https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/volttron-listener/blob/develop/tests/test_integration.py)
